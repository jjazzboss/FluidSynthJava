# FluidSynthJava

This package lets you use FluidSynth directly from Java. The connection to the FluidSynth native library is based on JEP 412 "Foreign Function &amp; Memory API" from Java 17.

The FluidSynthJava file provides Java API for a subset of the FluidSynth API, mainly to use FluidSynth as a software synth directly from your java program. This is used by the JJazzLab application.


### Configuration

This is designed for FluidSynth >= 2.3

- Windows: the native FluidSynth 2.3 native libraries (DLLs) are bundled in the package. 
- Mac/Linux: the native FluidSynth native libraries must have been installed in the standard directories.
